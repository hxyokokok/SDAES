# SDAES
Search Direction Adaptation Evolution Strategy

This is the source code of SDA-ES, a large-scale variant of the popular evolutionary algorithm CMA-ES.
SDA-ES is designed for solving large-scale black-box optimization problem. It is characterized by the rotational invariance and the derandomization property in adapting the mutation strength.
